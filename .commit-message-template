# Start with asking yourself - If applied, this commit will ... 
# make this imperative, i.e., "Fix Bug" instead of "Fixed / Fixes bug"
#
# Prefix the message with one of the tags - 
#   build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test
# So, the heading becomes - 
#
# [$tag]: <your commit heading here> [max. 70 chars]

# After that, leave a line and explain stuff like why this change is being made, etc.

# Provide links to any relevant tickets, articles or other resources
# - JIRA ticket:
# - Github issue:
# - See also: <link> [<link>]
